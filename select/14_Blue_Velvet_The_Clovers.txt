She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than may her tender sighs
Love was ours
Ours, the love i held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left
Gone was the golw of blue velvet
*But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm the memory
Through the years
And i still can see blue velvet
Through my tears
She wore blue velvet
(Repeat *)
