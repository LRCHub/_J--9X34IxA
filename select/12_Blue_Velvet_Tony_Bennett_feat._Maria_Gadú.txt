She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

De veludo azul
Mais que o azul do seu olhar
A tua boca a suspirar
Um querer

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

De veludo azul
Se revestiu meu coração

Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And we still can see blue velvet through our tears

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

De veludo azul
Se revestiu meu coração

Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And we still can see blue velvet through our tears

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

De veludo azul
Se revestiu meu coração

Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And we still can see blue velvet through our tears

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

De veludo azul
Se revestiu meu coração

Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And we still can see blue velvet through our tears
